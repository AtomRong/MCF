This is a LZMA lite library extracted from XZ Utils (http://tukaani.org/xz/)
which works for alone_encoder/alone_decoder only.

I have slightly modified some code to make it work without autoCRAP.
Hence a single command line such as 'rm -f liblzmalite.a && \
gcc -c -std=c99 *.c && ar rcs liblzmalite.a *.o' will work fine.
