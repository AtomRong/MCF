简介
Introduction
===================
MCF 是一个基于 C++14 的 Windows 框架。
MCF is a C++14 framework for Windows application development.

MCF 遵循“无尘设计”的原则。
其设计目标是将 C 和 C++ 的标准库连带 CRT 全部丢弃，然后重新设计，以期移除任何杂质和智障功能，包括区域和语言设置、标准输入输出流、线程和 thread_local 等。
MCF is a clean room design of C++.
That is, the goal of MCF is to destruct the C and C++ standard libraries as well as the CRT, then rebuild a subset of them, effectively removing mistaken features such as locales, iostreams, threads and thread_local, etc.

GIT SUCKS
===================
@FrankHB recommended this article https://gist.github.com/incompl/3819571 that I'd like to share with you.
Because that is exactly what I want to say and I am simply too busy to write one.
